I wished to try a WWAN, as my partner's carrier, Google Fi, provides data SIMs
at no additional charge, but
[PSREF lists them as unavailable in the US](https://psref.lenovo.com/Product/ThinkPad/ThinkPad_X1_Yoga_Gen_6). I've read one cannot be retroactively added due to a
missing antenna assembly.

I ordered the cheapest hard drive available and replaced it with a
"[Samsung 2TB 980 PRO PCIe 4.0 x4 M.2 Internal SSD](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1624326-REG/samsung_mz_v8p2t0b_am_2tb_980_pro_pcie.html)"
according to this
[replacement guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6zhenaLjho).

The builtin webcam is poor. The keyboard is lovely.

There seemed to be able to be a perpetual sale of some sort and I was also able
to use a partner discount.

### External GPU

- [AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Graphics processing unit](https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/5458372200/us)
- [Razer Core X Chroma enclosure](https://www.razer.com/gaming-egpus/razer-core-x/RC21-01430100-R3U1)
- [Noctua NF-A12x25 5V 120 mm fan](https://noctua.at/en/products/fan/nf-a12x25-5v)
- [Corsair SF750 80 Plus Platinum SFX Power Supply unit](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Power-Supply-Units/Power-Supply-Units-Advanced/SF-Series/p/CP-9020186-NA)
- [100 mm² x 1 mm thermal pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086W119DK)

I used the [egpu.io buyer's guide and forum](https://egpu.io) to inform.

The GPU fans don't ever see to run at a very fast rate but when they were above a low speed, they're noisy.

The original power supply's fan is always on. The replacement's doesn't turn on until the load exceeds 300 W. I would replace the fan in it but I don't think I've ever heard it turn on and I don't want to risk working near large capacitors. The replacement supply is so much smaller than the original and is unable to mount to anything so it rests on the thermal pad which I divided in half and stacked to align the plug with the opening. I don't think a thermal pad is necessary over a piece of appropriately sized metal but it's tacky which helps keep the unit in place.

I had replaced the side fan with a 12 V [Noctua NF-S12B redux-700](https://noctua.at/en/nf-s12b-redux-700) as I read that the enclosure's voltage was inconsistent but 5 V or above, it's [the quietest 120 mm fan available](https://www.quietpc.com/120mmfans), and I figured the worst case scenario would be that the GPU fans would kick on or the system would go into thermal shutdown. It worked and it was almost silent but I think the system was too hot. It was almost always quite warm and, when in heavy use, downright hot. I replaced the fan with the quietest 5 V fan available but it is significantly louder. The system is always quite cool now. Maybe a 140 mm would fit. I wish the enclosure had a 12 V PWM (four pin).

The GPU fans blow outward so I had flipped the direction of the side fan to blow inward but the GPU doesn't quite cover the air vent so I guessed that the original design to have both the side fan and GPU fans blowing outwards is probably best and have stuck with that. [The airflow direction of the side fan is from the manufacturer's label outwards](https://noctua.at/en/how-can-i-find-out-the-direction-of-airflow-and-sense-of-rotation). I imagine that the air could mostly flow in over the power supply where there's a small vent but the case is really just an approximation for any card that fits and having replaced the supply with such a different one, I suppose all bets are off.

## Back Up
1. Empty trash; consider dumping Steam and Wine games.
2. Export bookmarks and settings from Firefox and bookmarklets from Chromium.
3. Back up browser tabs, unsaved editor files (check Code, Sublime Text, and
   DeaDBeeF).
4. Back up packages and verify contents.
5. Check Grub options.
6. Take screenshot of launcher.
7. Copy files: `cd / && tarpipe /media/stephen/disk/home home`.
8. Backup with rsync too: `backup`. To-do: checksum tally as I go.
9. Download the latest [Debian stable release](https://cdimage.debian.org/images/unofficial/non-free/images-including-firmware/11.0.0+nonfree/amd64/iso-dvd/) and check `md5sum *.iso`.
10. Copy to USB thumbdrive (not SD Card): `mkfs.fat -I -n FOO /dev/sdX && time dd bs=4M if=foo.iso of=/dev/sdX`.

## Install

### BIOS

Set the sleep state to "Windows and Linux" for now. S3 seems to cause the
trackpad to stutter after sleep. I don't remember what else I changed but it was
a number of things, including, I think, enabling secure boot.

### Debian Installer

I wanted to increase the swap partition size but it didn't seem customizable in
itself. I haven't notice any out-of-memory issues.

![Optional software configuration](tasksel_first_0.png)

### Grub

Edit /etc/default/grub with the following
[temporary changes for keyboard lag](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-X-Series-Laptops/Lag-and-stuttering-on-X1-Carbon-Gen-9-while-running-Linux-untested-on-Windows/m-p/5082352):

```grub
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="i915.enable_psr=0"
```

### Firmware

The following grabbed the latest upgrades listed on the manufacturer's website:

```bash
fwupdmgr refresh
fwupdmgr get-devices
sudo fwupdmgr update
```

I had trouble getting fwupd to recognize my 8BitDo SF30 Pro controller and I'm unsure
if changing the controller's boot mode (maybe L1 + R1 + Start) or using a custom
fwupdmgr install fixed it. I used [macOS for the SN30 Pro+](https://support.8bitdo.com/firmware-updater.html) ([see issue](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/issues/1681)).

### External GPU

With the AMD graphic drives loaded (amdgpu), radeontop has very low usage during normal desktop usage and high usage playing games:

```bash
sudo radeontop
```

Without the AMD driver, usage was high for desktop.

to-do: revise the readout with the new cable.

Install the AMD driver with `sudo modprobe -v amdgpu` which will either quit the current session or hang it. In the latter case, reset it with `alt-prtsc-k`. I think this requires booting with the cable in.

`glxgears` should report ~60 FPS at any size. The open-source driver seems to flip between the integrated GPU for windowing and external GPU for 3D. The amdgpu driver uses external for everything, I think.

When using the stock open-source drivers, mine always showed the integrated GPU except when I explicitly used `DRI_PRIME=1 glxgears`. However, even when enabled, frame rates were terrible with the open-source drivers. I think game frame rates were ok but there was a ton of input lag on the mouse and keyboard. amdgpu doesn't perform very well either when forced:

```
$ DRI_PRIME=1 glxgears
libGL error: MESA-LOADER: failed to open iris: /opt/amdgpu/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/iris_dri.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory (search paths /opt/amdgpu/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri)
libGL error: failed to load driver: iris
19883 frames in 5.0 seconds = 3969.349 FPS
419 frames in 5.0 seconds = 83.784 FPS
420 frames in 5.0 seconds = 83.799 FPS
```

Without `DRI_PRIME`, it's fine:

```
$ glxgears
Running synchronized to the vertical refresh.  The framerate should be
approximately the same as the monitor refresh rate.
303 frames in 5.0 seconds = 60.570 FPS
300 frames in 5.0 seconds = 59.995 FPS
```

And:

```
vblank_mode=0 glxgears
ATTENTION: default value of option vblank_mode overridden by environment.
107644 frames in 5.0 seconds = 21528.650 FPS
88601 frames in 5.0 seconds = 17719.971 FPS
68304 frames in 5.0 seconds = 13660.693 FPS
68198 frames in 5.0 seconds = 13639.584 FPS
```

What doesn't work so far:
- Internal GPU performance suffers noticeably when the external GPU is detached. Window manager animations just jump and the unit is noticeably less efficient.
- Hotplugging and module loading. I have to power off, at/detach the cable, and `modprobe amdgpu`.
- Display sleeping for more than a minute. I use a script, `display-sleep`, power off the monitor, then run the script again on my laptop.
- After `amdgpu-install`, `apt` is broken. The system seems to work more or less but the installation is broken.

Observations:

- Max Payne 3 runs smoothly on nearly maxed out settings. Unfortunately, the internal GPU's memory is incorrectly identified as the limit and the game forbids exceeding it.
- Red Dead Redemption 2: still experimenting. I seem to get about 30 FPS with maxed or minimized settings but perhaps they're not taking.
- Portal runs smoothly on maxed out settings.
- Chrome's FPS meter is broken but Nature Elsewhere runs smoothly.
- NES runs smoothly.

### Groups

The input group is need for joystick access.

```bash
su -c '/sbin/usermod -aG sudo stephen' && echo ok
su -c '/sbin/usermod -aG input stephen' && echo ok
```

This required a reboot not just a logout.

### Inputs

Xbox mode (2 LEDs) works well. I calibrated and remapped axes with `jstest-gtk` then persisted the state with `sudo jscal-store /dev/input/js1`.

### Restore

1. Disable suspend on AC:
  ```bash
  gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-type &&
  gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-type nothing
  ```
2. `sudo apt install pigz vim`.
3. Decompress backup: `time tar xf /media/stephen/disk/home-2016-01-01-00-00-00-000000000.tar.gz -I pigz && echo ok`.

### APT

1. Open Software & Updates.
2. View Other Software.
3. Disable cdrom as a software source.

```bash
sudo apt update &&
sudo apt upgrade &&
sudo apt dist-upgrade &&
sudo apt install \

```

### NPM

```bash
npm i -g create-react-app live-server npm-check-updates source-map-explorer

```

The program settings are not easily isolated. They're smattered across the
Windows registry and elsewhere, unfortunately. Additionally, some are CD drive
specific.

### Chromium

1. Set chrome://flags/#force-color-profile to sRGB.
2. Disable cache in the DevTools network tab.

##### about://settings

- Check On startup -> Continue where you left off.
- Make Chromium the default.
- Change search to DuckDuckGo.
- Enable classic theme otherwise incognito mode isn't different enough.

### Firefox

I use Firefox as a bookmark manager presently. Debian stable is ancient so I had
to export my bookmarks as JSON and reimport them on the old version.

### Sublime Text

### Powertop

To-do: How can I run configure mode non-interactively until it has enough
samples?

```bash
sudo powertop -c
sudo powertop --auto-tune
```

Attempt most and automatically to modules:

```bash

sensors -u
```
