I wished to try a WWAN, as my carrier, Google Fi, provides data SIMs at no
additional charge, but
[PSREF lists them as unavailable in the US](https://psref.lenovo.com/Product/ThinkPad/ThinkPad_X1_Yoga_Gen_6).
I've read one cannot be retroactively added due to a missing antenna assembly.

I ordered the cheapest hard drive available and replaced it with a
"[Samsung 2TB 980 PRO PCIe 4.0 x4 M.2 Internal SSD](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1624326-REG/samsung_mz_v8p2t0b_am_2tb_980_pro_pcie.html)"
according to this
[replacement guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6zhenaLjho).
[I upgraded the firmware on Feb, 2023 following these notes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34649376).

The builtin webcam is poor. The keyboard is lovely.

I haven't made much use of its convertible functionality yet.

There seemed to be able to be a perpetual sale of some sort and I was also able
to use a partner discount.

### External GPU

- [AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT Graphics processing unit](https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/5458372200/us)
- [Razer Core X Chroma enclosure](https://www.razer.com/gaming-egpus/razer-core-x/RC21-01430100-R3U1)
- [Noctua NF-A12x25 5V 120 mm fan](https://noctua.at/en/products/fan/nf-a12x25-5v)
- [Corsair SF750 80 Plus Platinum SFX Power Supply unit](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Power-Supply-Units/Power-Supply-Units-Advanced/SF-Series/p/CP-9020186-NA)
- [100 mm² x 1 mm thermal pad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086W119DK)

I used the [egpu.io buyer's guide and forum](https://egpu.io) to inform.

The GPU fans don't ever see to run at a very fast rate but when they were above
a low speed, they're noisy.

The original power supply's fan is always on. The replacement's doesn't turn on
until the load exceeds 300 W. I would replace the fan in it but I don't think
I've ever heard it turn on and I don't want to risk working near large
capacitors. The replacement supply is so much smaller than the original and is
unable to mount to anything so it rests on the thermal pad which I divided in
half and stacked to align the plug with the opening. I don't think a thermal
pad is necessary over a piece of appropriately sized metal but it's tacky which
helps keep the unit in place.

I had replaced the side fan with a 12 V
[Noctua NF-S12B redux-700](https://noctua.at/en/nf-s12b-redux-700) as I read
that the enclosure's voltage was inconsistent but 5 V or above, it's
[the quietest 120 mm fan available](https://www.quietpc.com/120mmfans), and I
figured the worst case scenario would be that the GPU fans would kick on or the
system would go into thermal shutdown. It worked and it was almost silent but I
think the system was too hot. It was almost always quite warm and, when in heavy
use, downright hot.

I replaced the fan with the quietest 5 V fan available but
it is significantly louder. The system is always quite cool now. Maybe a 140 mm
would fit. I wish the enclosure had a 12 V PWM (four pin). The GPU fans turn off
when they can.

The GPU fans blow outward so I had flipped the direction of the side fan to blow
inward but the GPU doesn't quite cover the air vent so I guessed that the
original design to have both the side fan and GPU fans blowing outwards is
probably best and have stuck with that.
[The airflow direction of the side fan is from the manufacturer's label outwards](https://noctua.at/en/how-can-i-find-out-the-direction-of-airflow-and-sense-of-rotation).
I imagine that the air could mostly flow in over the power supply where there's
a small vent but the case is really just an approximation for any card that fits
and having replaced the supply with such a different one, I suppose all bets are
off. In both directions, the fans seem to pull in a lot of particulates despite
resting high on my desk shelf.

I disabled the enclosure LEDs by disconnecting the jumper cable running between the mounted circuit board and the two LED strips. I put black electrical tape over the GPU's AMD LED logo which is always lit. I can hear the side-fan to know when it's on (it turns off when the case is powered but the GPU is unused).

I've tried many mice and keyboards. I waffle a bit due to wrist health.

### Desk

- [Bamboo, curved, UPLIFT standing desk with black v2-commercial C-frame 72" x 30"](https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-v2-standing-desk-v2-or-v2-commercial)
  - I'd get the flat edge next time and maybe a larger size.
  - KBT009-BLK Quick-Adjust Mechanism
  - UPLIFT Track Spacer
- [8-Outlet mountable surge protector](https://www.upliftdesk.com/8-outlet-mountable-surge-protector-uplift-desk)

I tried the desk keyboard tray. I liked the extra dimension but ultimately it was too small and a little too bendy.

## Back Up

1. Empty trash; consider dumping Steam and Wine games.
2. Export bookmarks and settings from Firefox and bookmarklets from Chromium.
3. Back up browser tabs, unsaved editor files (check Code, Sublime Text, and
   DeaDBeeF).
4. Back up packages and verify contents.
5. Check Grub options.
6. Take screenshot of launcher.
7. Copy files to two disks: `cd / && tarpipe /media/user/disk/home home`.
8. Backup with rsync too: `backup`. To-do: checksum tally as I go.
9. Download the latest [Debian stable release](https://cdimage.debian.org/images/release/12.0.0/amd64/iso-bd) and check `md5sum *.iso`.
10. Copy to USB thumbdrive (not SD Card): `time sudo sh -c 'cat > /dev/sdX' < debian-live-12.0.0-amd64-gnome.iso`. I use `gnome-disks` to unmount any preexisting partitions.
11. Review [the release notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/amd64/release-notes).

## Install

### BIOS

I don't remember what else I changed but it was a number of things, including, I
think, enabling secure boot and enabling "Linux" / S3 sleep.

### Debian Installer

![Disk partition configuration](partman_choose_partition_0.png)

### Firmware

The following grabbed the latest upgrades listed on the manufacturer's website:

```bash
fwupdmgr refresh
fwupdmgr get-devices
sudo fwupdmgr update
```

I had trouble getting fwupd to recognize my 8BitDo SF30 Pro controller and I'm unsure
if changing the controller's boot mode (maybe L1 + R1 + Start) or using a custom
fwupdmgr install fixed it. I used [macOS for the SN30 Pro+](https://support.8bitdo.com/firmware-updater.html) ([see issue](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/issues/1681)).

### External GPU

I test cable speed and verify authorization with:

#### Stock

With the stock install, both internal and external GPUs seem to work. However, I got very poor actual framerate for applications, WebGL, and games. WebGL ran at about 45 FPS and everything felt sluggish and not snappy. For a heavy game, The Ascent, I could see it hitting the GPU hard in radeontop but it still felt slow. The Ascent also prompted for Vulkan shader compilation each time. Plain desktop apps also seem to use the external GPU according to radeontop.

I'm unsure what's actually using the external GPU. `radeontop` only works on AMD cards (I tried to test my Intel card using the `--bus` option) and I see the pipe saturation bouncing regularly during normal desktop app usage and totally packed when playing a game. I see 16302M VRAM and 15887M GTT.

```bash
sudo radeontop
```

`glxgears` at full screen bumps the graphics pipe up to about 50-70%:

```
$ glxgears
Running synchronized to the vertical refresh.  The framerate should be
approximately the same as the monitor refresh rate.
210 frames in 5.0 seconds = 41.779 FPS
213 frames in 5.0 seconds = 42.461 FPS
214 frames in 5.0 seconds = 42.765 FPS

$ vblank_mode=0 glxgears
ATTENTION: default value of option vblank_mode overridden by environment.
5136 frames in 5.0 seconds = 1027.107 FPS
5145 frames in 5.0 seconds = 1028.894 FPS
5074 frames in 5.0 seconds = 1014.769 FPS
```

I see confusingly bad results with the AMD GPU selected:

```
$ DRI_PRIME=1 glxgears
Running synchronized to the vertical refresh.  The framerate should be
approximately the same as the monitor refresh rate.
211 frames in 5.0 seconds = 42.187 FPS
203 frames in 5.0 seconds = 40.466 FPS
201 frames in 5.0 seconds = 39.978 FPS

$ DRI_PRIME=1 vblank_mode=0 glxgears
ATTENTION: default value of option vblank_mode overridden by environment.
276 frames in 5.0 seconds = 55.116 FPS
299 frames in 5.0 seconds = 59.654 FPS
303 frames in 5.0 seconds = 60.520 FPS
```

Steam steams to detect both cards but only reports the primary GPU, whatever it is. Before all-ways-egpu, I saw the internal Intel card:

Hot-plugging works so long as nothing is actively using the GPU, I think. I don't know how to test this so before I un/plug, I close all my programs (which is also good if it crashes).

After rebooting, my external GPU was the primary and all games and apps felt silky smooth except my WebGL games which all performed better but still frequently drop frames and bounce around between 55-58 FPS.

Hotplugging no longer works. When I disconnect the cable, it often hangs the OS. When I insert the cable, it often hangs the OS and doesn't use the external GPU when it doesn't. I verified the GPU by measuring the throughput drop with `vblank_mode=0 glxgears`. I really trust the glxgears output now.

When I use the Thunderbolt cables in parallel (one for GPU, one for everything else), I get a 10% performance increase with `vblank_mode=0 glxgears` and the system seems to run more smoothly on the whole. Once, with the cables in serial, I had a second or two hiccup.

#### Observations

These are dated from the closed source driver:

- Max Payne 3 runs smoothly on nearly maxed out settings. Unfortunately, the internal GPU's memory is incorrectly identified as the limit and the game forbids exceeding it.
- Red Dead Redemption 2 runs smoothly with maxed out settings.
- Cyberpunk 2077 v1.3 was pretty choppy and at 1920x1080 and it didn't seem to matter what quality. Indoor battles were smooth though. v1.5 was a lot better but still lagged periodically, especially when driving.
- Portal runs smoothly on maxed out settings.
- NES runs smoothly.

Open-source driver:

- The Ascent runs well on the ultra preset. It's playable but feels laggy and I don't know if that's the game or my system or both. Pipe is fully saturated most of the time and I see the memory at 30% ish or so.
- [Super Patience](https://superpatience.com) runs between 55-58 FPS.

### Groups

The input group is need for joystick access.

```bash
su -c '/sbin/usermod -aG sudo user' && echo ok
su -c '/sbin/usermod -aG input user' && echo ok
```

This required a reboot not just a logout.

### Inputs

Xbox mode (2 LEDs) works well. I remapped axes and then calibrated with `jstest-gtk` then persisted the state with `sudo jscal-store /dev/input/js1`.

### Restore

1. Disable suspend on AC:

```bash
gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-type &&
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-type nothing
```

2. `sudo apt install pigz vim`.
3. Decompress backup: `time tar --extract --file=/media/user/disk/home-2016-01-01-00-00-00-000000000.tar.gz --use-compress-program=pigz && echo ok`.

### APT

1. Open Software & Updates.
2. Enable DFSG-compatible Software with Non-Free Dependencies (contrib).

```bash
sudo apt update &&
sudo apt upgrade &&
sudo apt dist-upgrade &&
sudo apt install \
  bash-completion build-essential chromium command-not-found curl diffpdf \
  docker-compose entr flac flatpak fontforge fonts-roboto git gnome-screenshot \
  gpick gthumbhtop imagemagick inkscape jstest-gtk libimage-exiftool-perl \
  lm-sensors lshw meld mpv pigz potrace powertop pv radeontop rsync \
  ttf-bitstream-vera vim whois wl-clipboard zoxide &&
sudo apt remove thunderbird &&
sudo apt autoremove
```

Sometimes I'll also install:

```bash
sudo apt install \
  blender colordiff csvtool mesa-utils moreutils nmap opus-tools scrcpy \
  sg3-utils sox tmux sqlitebrowser wmctrl xclip xdotool
```

#### Compare Previously Installed Packages

```bash
alias strip='sed -r "1,5 d; s%^(ii|rc)\s+([^ ]+).*%\2%"' &&
meld <(strip dpkg.text|sort) <(dpkg --list|strip|sort)
```

### Flatpak

```bash
flatpak remote-add flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install \
  com.calibre_ebook.calibre \
  com.github.AmatCoder.mednaffe \
  com.github.johnfactotum.Foliate \
  com.github.tenderowl.frog \
  com.obsproject.Studio \
  com.uploadedlobster.peek \
  com.usebottles.bottles \
  org.gimp.GIMP \
  org.kde.krita \
  org.musicbrainz.Picard
```

## Software and Update

- Enable Non-DFSG-compatible for Hardware Support (non-free-firmware)
- Enable Non-DFSG-compatible Software (non-free)

## Software

- Disable menu -> Update Preferences -> Automatic Updates.

### NPM

Sometimes I'll install:

```bash
npm i -g create-react-app live-server npm-check-updates source-map-explorer wscat
```

### Wine

Sometimes I'll install:

```bash
sudo apt install wine winetricks winbind &&
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 &&
sudo apt update && sudo apt install wine32
```

I am trying to use [Bottles](https://usebottles.com) (via Flatpak) and [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover) more. 

#### Exact Audio Copy

```bash
# Select the default prefix and install just dotnet20 without the service packs.
WINEARCH=win64 WINEPREFIX="$HOME/bin/eac" winetricks
WINEARCH=win64 WINEPREFIX="$HOME/bin/eac" wine ~/dl/eac-1.6.exe
```

The program settings are not easily isolated. They're smattered across the
Windows registry and elsewhere, unfortunately. Additionally, some are CD drive
specific.

### Chromium

- Set about://flags/#force-color-profile to sRGB.
- Disable cache in the DevTools network tab.
- Enable Search message content on Proton.

### Firefox

I use Firefox as a bookmark manager presently. Debian stable is ancient so I had
to export my bookmarks as JSON and reimport them on the old version.

### Sublime Text 4

```bash
curl https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg |
sudo apt-key add -
echo 'deb https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/stable/' |
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sublime-text.list
sudo apt update &&
sudo apt install sublime-text
# Register.

### Tweaks

- Set monospace text to Bitstream Vera Sans Mono Roman size 13
- Add weekday to top bar and change time format to 12h

### MakeMKV

1. [Download the latest](https://www.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=224).
2. Install dependencies:

```
sudo apt install libbluray-dev libbluray2 libbluray-bdj libaacs0 libaacs-dev libbdplus0 libbdplus-dev
```

3. Install ffmpeg dependencies:

```
sudo apt install nasm yasm libfdk-aac2 libfdk-aac-dev
```

4. Follow the directions to install ffmpeg with libfdk-aac support to a temporary directory.
5. Follow the forum directions including installing the dependencies they specify (I couldn't get a prefix install to work).
6. Register via the GUI.

If it doesn't work, you probably have the disc number wrong.

### Powertop

To-do: How can I run configure mode non-interactively until it has enough
samples?

```bash
# Disable screensaver.
